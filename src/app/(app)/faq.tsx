      'After verification on cardlessid.org, you receive a digital credential stored in your Algorand blockchain wallet. Websites can verify your age via QR code, and the wallet responds with true/false along with your wallet addressâ€”no other personal data is shared.',

      "Yes! Zero information about you is stored in any database except what's necessary to prevent DOS attacks and provide sybil resistance. Your credential only confirms age eligibility without revealing identity.",
